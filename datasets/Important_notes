The raw picrust2 and qiime2 datasets are too large to be pushed to GitHub.
You can unzip the compressed folders from /datasets. If you move the unzipped
folders elsewhere in the repo, please change the file path(s) indicated 
in the .gitignore file (root directory). Otherwise, you might run into a problem like the
author of this message did.

Contents:
- picrust2_outputs.zip: combined_EC_predicted.tsv, combined_KO_predicted.tsv,
  path_abun_unstrat.tsv, pred_metagenome_unstrat.tsv
- qiime2_outputs.zip: taxonomy.tsv, feature-table.tsv, tree.nwk

--------
- metadata_formatted.csv, counts_formatted.csv, and taxonomy_formatted.csv were
  generated within phyloseq.Rmd. They were saved within the repo for your
  convenience. The original datasets had some issues when they were loaded into
  R. (Or you could use ps_taxonomy.rds to access the data)
