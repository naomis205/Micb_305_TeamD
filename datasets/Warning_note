The raw picrust2 and qiime2 datasets are too large to be pushed to GitHub.
You can unzip the compressed folders from /datasets. If you move these
folders elsewhere in the repo, please change the file path(s) indicated 
in the .gitignore file. Otherwise, you might run into a problem like the
author of this message did.

Contents:
- picrust2_outputs.zip: combined_EC_predicted.tsv, combined_KO_predicted.tsv,
  path_abun_unstrat.tsv
- qiime2_outputs.zip: taxonomy.tsv, feature-table.tsv, tree.nwk
