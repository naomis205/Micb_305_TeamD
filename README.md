# Meeting Minutes

## October 22, 2025
**Agenda:**

- Discuss project proposal
- Align aims with expected outcomes
- Improve understanding of expected outcomes
  
## October 15, 2025
**Agenda:**

- Background reading and hypotheses formation discussion
  - Informative evidence type for dietary restrictions related to MS

- MS Dataset
  - Sample size (total ~ 900)
    - filtered for MS and HC with lactose intolerance
      - HC with LI only = 19
      - MS with LI only = 19
      - Could proceed with downstream analysis, but considered a limitation
      
  - Functional analysis example:
    - In HC, function of bacteria is eg. to digest lactose
    - Then, compare the MS (LT) and HC (LT) individuals to see if this bacteria is further depleted/missing in MS individuals
    
  - Background research and hypothesis formation paths:
    - background research: lactose intolerance affects the gut microbiome
    - background research: MS affects the gut microbiome
    - hypothesis: therefore, significance between LT and MS gut microbiome diversity
    
  - Significance (proposal):
    -  We see LT quite often, therefore, examining LT, could have implications on other dietary restrictions
      - Implications include: lifestyles to accomodate for MS, what considerations to make/lookout etc. 
    - If LT results are different from no-LT in MS, and we know Caucasians have more dairy in diet, therefore??
    - If cannot determine significance, just write 1-2 sentences on why we are interested
    
  - Downstream analysis:
    -   If overall no difference: calculate the percent of LT in HC and MS populations,
        see if MS has a higher %, then suggest for further study
    
- Goals this week/next week:
  - Determine hypothesis
  
**Action Items**:
- Write a detailed experimental aim:
  - What type of analysis will we do?
  - How does this analysis contribute to our hypothesis?
- Importing the data and completing QIIME
- **NOTE**: Proposal: Overall RQ, Hypothesis + justification of hypothesis

## October 8, 2025

**Agenda:**

-   **Roundtable for Project Ideas**
    -   MS:
        -   **NOTE:** Processing will take a long time due to size of
            dataset
        -   MS in adults vs. children
            -   Some similar studies in the past
            -   Would need to import external dataset by end of week if
                idea chosen
        -   MS disease severity and smoking
            -   Has not been done in the course yet
            -   Disease severity significant topic to examine
        -   Link b/tw dietary restriction and MS
            -   Lactose intolerance functional analysis
            -   Take into account chosen dietary restrictions
    -   Gastric Cancer:
        -   **NOTE**: Gastric cancer dataset is suspicious...
        -   BMI affecting microbiome composition in different stages of
            gastric cancer progression
            -   No one considered unhealthy BMI in gastric cancer
                dataset .: would be difficult to find differences
        -   Comparison b/tw Yu and Wang gastric cancer studies
            -   Datasets ambiguous
-   **Final Project Decision:**
    -   MS dataset -\> download from server, NOT Canvas (\~900 sample
        size)
    -   **Research Project:** Dietary restriction (specifically lactose
        intolerance)

**Action Items**:

-   Conduct background research & draft a hypothesis

-   Summarize sample numbers in cohorts (lactose vs. non-lactose
    intolerant; MS vs. healthy controls; types of MS)

-   If time: Start processing data -\> refer to Modules

## October 1, 2025

Interest in MS, Parkinson's, and Gastic Cancer metadata - The MS dataset
is large, so there’s lots to work with - MS has high variability - Lots
of confounding variables to correct for (i.e. asthma) - Could look at
symptoms of MS - Lots of UJEMI literature – check if there’s any
literature on it so you don’t repeat what’s already been done – want
good project – look at future directions, limitations for those
papers. - Gastic Cancer has small metadata – not a lot of samples (311)

To do:

-   Find two papers to support hypothesis based on research questions
    you have

-   Hypotheses can be upstream or downstream:

-   Upstream: Why does it happen?

-   Downstream: What’s the effect of this happening?

-   Try to find relationships within data related to research questions
    using indirect (explanatory) variables

-   Attempt to find evidence that supports both upstream and downstream
    and form hypotheses based on it.

-   Consider gaps in the field?

-   Send any datasets of interest to the teaching team, by Friday.

-   By next week – commit to one or few datasets

-   Brainstorm for next week
