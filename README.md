Interest in MS, Parkinson's, and Gastic Cancer metadata
- The MS dataset is large, so there’s lots to work with
-	MS has high variability
-	Lots of confounding variables to correct for (i.e. asthma)
-	Could look at symptoms of MS 
-	Lots of UJEMI literature – check if there’s any literature on it so you don’t repeat what’s already been done – want good project – look at future directions, limitations for those papers.
- Gastic Cancer has small metadata – not a lot of samples (311)

To do:

- Find two papers to support hypothesis based on research questions you have

- Hypotheses can be upstream or downstream:
- Upstream: Why does it happen?
- Downstream: What’s the effect of this happening?
- Try to find relationships within data related to research questions using indirect (explanatory) variables
- Attempt to find evidence that supports both upstream and downstream and form hypotheses based on it.
- Consider gaps in the field?

-	Send any datasets of interest to the teaching team, by Friday.
  
-	By next week – commit to one or few datasets
  
-	Brainstorm for next week
