# Meeting Minutes

## October 8, 2025

**Agenda:**

-   **Roundtable for Project Ideas**
    -   MS:
        -   **NOTE:** Processing will take a long time due to size of
            dataset
        -   MS in adults vs. children
            -   Some similar studies in the past
            -   Would need to import external dataset by end of week if
                idea chosen
        -   MS disease severity and smoking
            -   Has not been done in the course yet
            -   Disease severity significant topic to examine
        -   Link b/tw dietary restriction and MS
            -   Lactose intolerance functional analysis
            -   Take into account chosen dietary restrictions
    -   Gastric Cancer:
        -   **NOTE**: Gastric cancer dataset is suspicious...
        -   BMI affecting microbiome composition in different stages of
            gastric cancer progression
            -   No one considered unhealthy BMI in gastric cancer
                dataset .: would be difficult to find differences
        -   Comparison b/tw Yu and Wang gastric cancer studies
            -   Datasets ambiguous
-   **Final Project Decision:**
    -   MS dataset -\> download from server, NOT Canvas (\~900 sample
        size)
    -   **Research Project:** Dietary restriction (specifically lactose
        intolerance)

**Action Items**:

-   Conduct background research & draft a hypothesis

-   Summarize sample numbers in cohorts (lactose vs. non-lactose
    intolerant; MS vs. healthy controls; types of MS)

-   If time: Start processing data -\> refer to Modules

Interest in MS, Parkinson's, and Gastic Cancer metadata - The MS dataset
is large, so there’s lots to work with - MS has high variability - Lots
of confounding variables to correct for (i.e. asthma) - Could look at
symptoms of MS - Lots of UJEMI literature – check if there’s any
literature on it so you don’t repeat what’s already been done – want
good project – look at future directions, limitations for those
papers. - Gastic Cancer has small metadata – not a lot of samples (311)

To do:

-   Find two papers to support hypothesis based on research questions
    you have

-   Hypotheses can be upstream or downstream:

-   Upstream: Why does it happen?

-   Downstream: What’s the effect of this happening?

-   Try to find relationships within data related to research questions
    using indirect (explanatory) variables

-   Attempt to find evidence that supports both upstream and downstream
    and form hypotheses based on it.

-   Consider gaps in the field?

-   Send any datasets of interest to the teaching team, by Friday.

-   By next week – commit to one or few datasets

-   Brainstorm for next week
